# Changelog

All notable changes per roadmap feature. Versions follow `v0.<feature>.0` until the app replaces
the Excel workbook.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — F1 reference data

### F1 — Accounts, categories and merchant rules
- Tables `core.account`, `core.category` (two levels, kind, color, fixed flag) and
  `core.merchant_rule` (contains / starts with / regex, priority) — migration 0002.
- Seed v1 from the project instructions (8 accounts with last four digits only, the category tree,
  50 merchant rules) — migration 0003, with a working downgrade.
- Rule engine: first active rule by priority wins; case and spacing ignored; invalid regex refused.
- API: list/create/update accounts and categories; CRUD for merchant rules; `/api/merchant-rules/test`.
- Settings page (Accounts, Categories, Merchant rules tabs) with inline edits, add forms and a rule
  tester, in the Mercado style, desktop and phone.
- Playwright end-to-end tests run in CI against the Docker image and SQL Server.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-19

### F0 — Walking skeleton and pipeline
- FastAPI app with `/api/health` (version, git SHA, database check) and `/api/me`.
- Email allow-list middleware for Container Apps sign-in.
- Alembic baseline creating the `raw`, `stg`, `rej`, `core`, `mart` and `audit` schemas.
- React shell with navigation to every planned page and a database status pill.
- Mercado design system (docs/design-system.md): color tokens with dark mode, Bricolage Grotesque + Figtree, category colors, button and behaviour rules; shell restyled with it.
- Single Docker image (API serves the web build); Docker Compose with SQL Server 2022.
- CI (lint, types, unit and integration tests, secret scan, image build) and deploy-on-merge to
  Azure Container Apps with smoke test and manual rollback.
- Azure Bicep (Container App, Azure SQL free offer with auto-pause, Blob, budget) and bootstrap script.
- Bootstrap registers resource providers, supports a separate SQL region and trusts GitHub's
